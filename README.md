# Weather-Climate-Change-and-Energy-Efficiency-Data-sets

The below data sets are relevant for organizations and users interested in weather patterns, as well as climate change and energy efficiency-related product development. 

National Weather Service (API)
NOAA's National Weather Service provides weather forecasts, watch & warnings, advisories, and storm prediction that provides the public, government agencies, and commercial enterprises with data from the National Weather Service's digital forecast database.

NOAA Climate Data Online (API)
Climate Data Online provides free access to National Climatic Data Center’s archive of global historical weather and climate data in addition to station history information. These data include daily, monthly, seasonal, and yearly measurements of temperature, precipitation, wind, and degree days as well as radar data and 30-year Climate Normals. API methods support retrieval of data for a specified time range, annual, monthly, daily, or hourly.

NOAA Severe Weather Data Inventory (API, bulk download)
The Severe Weather Data Inventory is a dataset of severe weather records for the U.S that integrates records from a variety of NOAA sources. The API is able to specify a dataset and date range, and filter results using a variety of parameters.

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Monthly Imagery Composites (bulk download)
VIIRS, a scanning radiometer, collects visible and infrared imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans. VIIRS data is used to measure cloud and aerosol properties, ocean color, sea and land surface temperature, ice motion and temperature, fires, and the proportion of the Earth’s surface that reflects light and radiation.

Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (bulk)
The Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility is a unique laboratory at the National Institute of Standards that mimics a suburban American home, but is equipped with solar panels and other energy efficient appliances, as well as robots that live there whose behavior mirrors that of a four person family. The NetZero Test Facility has recently given more energy back to the grid than it consumes and the correspondig dataset includes over 400 variables from the home, including temperature in all areas inside and outside the home, energy usage, and energy production by the solar panel system, at minute-level granularity.
